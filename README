project: Mandala

Alexandra Okeson
CSCI5229 Fall 2016

Allows users to create a mandala by drawing 3 dimensional shapes and then automatically
rotating those shapes about the y axis.

I am particularly proud of how the shapes are rotated around the y axis. I had to convert from x,y coordinates to spherical coordinates to get the position. I also had to set the correct rotation angles for each shape. In order to be able to accommodate any number of rotations, I had to do this dynamically so I had to figure out the math and write and algorithm to represent how much each angle and x,y coordinate would change based on the integer number of rotations.

The other thing that I worked a long time on were the buttons. I had to program them so that they did not resize when I resized the window and also did not move when I resized the window. I also had to ensure that these elements were not effected by lighting or other changes in the scene. While I downloaded the code to make the button press work, I had to figure out all of the resizing, placement, functions to make the buttons to manipulate the scene myself.
